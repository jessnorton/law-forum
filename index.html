    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p><h2>When the Guide to Law School Forum was created, the main goal in mind was how
        to create a safe space for future and current students of Law to network,
        socialize, and learn from each other. As we brainstormed ways to accomplish
        this mission, a secondary goal was found: to support, encourage, and advise
        students of color to pursue a career in the legal field. According to data
        on law school enrollment, not even a third of law students belong to black
        and brown communities. Since the legal system is a major factor in the inequities
        that marginalized communities face, itâ€™s crucial that we promote the success of
        black and brown pre-law students.</h2>
